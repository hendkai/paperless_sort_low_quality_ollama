High quality means the content is clear, organized, and meaningful.
Respond strictly with "low quality" or "high quality".
Content:

LOW_QUALITY_TAG_ID = 23  # Replace with the actual tag ID for low quality
HIGH_QUALITY_TAG_ID = 24  # Replace with the actual tag ID for high quality
MODEL_NAME = 'llama3'  # Replace with the actual model name to be used
MAX_DOCUMENTS = 5  # Set the maximum number of documents to process
